## Interaction Rules

1.  **Confirmation before starting a step/sub-step:** Before starting any step or sub-step from the `PLAN.md`, I will explicitly ask for your confirmation.
2.  **User Validation Instructions:** When running the application for user validation, I will provide clear, step-by-step instructions on how to test the implemented behavior.
3.  **Mandatory Testing:** For every step or sub-step implemented, I will implement tests and validate them *before* asking you (the user) for validation.
4.  **Plan Updates:** Before executing any operation, I will first update the `PLAN.md` to indicate which specific task is being performed.
