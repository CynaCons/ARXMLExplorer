# ARXMLExplorer Plan – Checklist

## Status
- [x] All core features complete (11/11)
- [x] Production ready
- [x] Major bug fixed: TabController sync with provider
- [x] AUTOSAR XSD integration
- [x] Strong test coverage

## Core Functionality
- [x] ARXML File Loading
- [x] Hierarchical Viewing (tree)
- [x] File Management (multi-tab)
- [x] File Persistence (Save/Create) – AppBar buttons wired
- [x] Searching (case sensitivity, scroll-to-result)

## Editing Capabilities
- [x] Element Modification (edit text/nodes)
- [x] Element Creation & Deletion (CRUD)
- [x] Schema‑Compliant Editing & Creation (XsdParser caching, limits, timeouts)

## UI/UX & Performance
- [x] Collapsing/Uncollapsing
- [x] Default Node Collapsing
- [x] Visual Enhancements (DepthIndicator, cues)
- [x] Loading Indicator (provider-driven)
- [x] Collapse/Expand All (AppBar buttons)
- [x] Optimized Scrolling & Performance
- [x] Subtle color theming (brand-inspired palette, gradient AppBar, styled TabBar)

## Testing
- [x] Search tests (3/3)
- [x] Schema validation tests (6/6)
- [x] XSD parser tests (namespaces, groups/choices, caching/perf)
- [x] File management tests
- [x] Editing features tests
- [x] File loading integration tests
- [x] TabController debug tests (verified fix)
- [x] Performance protections (timeouts, caching, limits)

## Recent Accomplishments
- [x] Fixed TabController updates on provider state changes (_updateTabController in build + post-frame)
- [x] Verified real file load on Windows desktop
- [x] Improved logs for loading and state transitions
- [x] Per‑tab XSD selection UI (picker button, per‑tab indicator, default fallback)
- [x] XsdParser enhancements: namespace‑agnostic indexes, complexContent, @ref resolution, xs:all, improved attribute discovery
- [x] UI color refresh with gradient AppBar and TabBar styling

## XSD Workflow Improvements
- [x] Namespace-agnostic matching (use localName + resolve prefixes/URIs)
- [x] Follow xs:complexContent (extension/restriction) to sequences/choices
- [x] Resolve xs:element @ref and @type properly (strip prefixes, index first)
- [x] Handle xs:all
- [ ] Improve traversal for nested sequences/choices/groups (deeper where safe)
- [x] Correct attribute discovery (look up element by @name → type → attributes)
- [ ] Increase traversal depth/limits for AUTOSAR (configurable) with visited set
- [x] Build indexes on load: elementsByName, groupsByName, typesByName
- [ ] Add verbose diagnostics toggle to print resolution path per element
- [ ] Add unit tests with AUTOSAR samples for key elements (SWC, Ports, Packages)
- [ ] Support substitutionGroup (collect concrete substitutable elements)

## Optional Enhancements (Backlog)
- [ ] XSD schema selection UI
  - [x] AppBar action to pick .xsd via file picker
  - [x] Per-tab selected schema with status indicator
  - [ ] Persist last-used XSD path (per session)
  - [x] Fallback to built-in AUTOSAR_00050.xsd
- [ ] Add more integration tests for save/load round‑trip
- [ ] Performance monitoring/metrics for large files
- [ ] UI polish and micro‑animations
