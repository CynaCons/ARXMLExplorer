# ARXMLExplorer Plan – Checklist

# ITERATION 1 - UI, Navigation, Workspace & XSD Remediation (Aug 2025 Active Work)

## Meta & Process
- [x] Repo analysis: Good/Bad/Ugly report delivered (Sep 2025)
- [x] Read project docs (README, PRD, RULES, architecture)
- [x] Ran full test suite and captured status summary

### Test Status Snapshot (latest local run)
- [x] Ran `flutter test` (Flutter 3.35.0 beta) — results:
  - Passed: 78
  - Skipped: 1
  - Failed: 0
  - Notes: Updated tests to align with NavigationRail labels/icons and default-collapsed behavior.

Resolved test updates:
- [x] visuals_ux_test: expect outlined icons (`file_open_outlined`, `create_new_folder_outlined`).
- [x] ui_ux_features_test: expandAll assertion accepts >= initial due to default-collapsed nodes.
- [x] editing_schema_test: expect outlined icons.
- [x] file_handling_test: use outlined icons for taps and visibility.
- [x] integration/file_loading_integration_test: verify `NavigationRail` and initial hint instead of AppBar title; use outlined icon.
- [x] navigation_rail_test: use `textContaining('XSD Catalog')`; return to Editor by tapping rail label.
- [x] performance_test: expect outlined icons.
- [x] search_and_scroll_test: tap outlined file-open icon.

Context: Many failures expect specific AppBar title, labels, or icons. Recent UI refactors (NavigationRail, AppBar) likely renamed/relocated these widgets; tests may need updates to new texts/semantics or the UI should reintroduce stable keys/labels.

## Documentation & Cleanup (Sep 2025)
- [x] Create RULES.md with dependency rules
- [x] Refresh README (remove mojibake, add XSD provisioning)
- [x] Fix mojibake in AGENTS.md and docs/architecture.md
- [x] Update pubspec description
- [x] Prune unused deps (provider, fluent_ui, flutter_simple_treeview, plugin_platform_interface)
- [x] Add coverage/ to .gitignore
- [x] Add tool to verify XSD presence (tool/verify_xsds.dart)

## Editor Tree Defaults
- [x] Default-collapse ADMIN-DATA containers in ARXML parse tree
- [x] Test: ADMIN-DATA nodes start collapsed by default
- [x] Note behavior in code comments and link to PRD

## Summary of Remaining Tasks
### Testing
- [ ] `autosar_xsd_children_test`: Fix XSD children resolution for APPLICATION-INTERFACE.
- [ ] `search_and_scroll_test.dart`: Stabilize flaky test with deterministic provider-driven paths.
- [ ] Add Collapse/Expand All UI actions or refactor test to use provider API.
- [ ] Update legacy test scaffolds to new AppRoot/HomeShell and editor provider APIs.
- [ ] Tame `pumpAndSettle` in `search_and_scroll_test` with bounded pumps and fast animations.
- [ ] Write golden test for updated NavigationRail (light/dark).
- [ ] Write widget test for overflow menu actions (e.g., toggle diagnostics).
- [ ] Write accessibility test for focus traversal sequence.
- [ ] Write regression test to ensure stray "ARXML" element is no longer present.
- [ ] Expand test for keyboard navigation to keep node centered.
- [ ] Add test for switching from mouse-click highlight to keyboard.
- [ ] Write golden diff test for NavigationRail indicator alignment.
- [ ] Add test for schema badge visibility in light & dark themes.
- [ ] Add test to ensure known invalid child is still reported after detection rewrite.
- [ ] Add test for warning appearance when no schema is available.

### Accessibility & UI/UX
- [ ] Ensure minimum tap target of >= 44x44 for rail destinations and toolbar icons.
- [ ] Implement focus outline & keyboard navigation order for rail & overflow menu.
- [ ] Perform color contrast audit for new square indicator (WCAG AA).
- [ ] Audit tooltip text for clarity and consistency.
- [ ] Fix NavigationRail indicator alignment to exactly overlay icon bounds.
- [ ] Adjust padding so indicator encloses icon+label without vertical drift.
- [ ] Fix XSD selector visibility (white-on-white) by applying contrasting background or text color.
- [ ] Implement UI to manage XSD sources & catalog.

### Features & Logic
- [ ] Implement optional "loop add" UX (Add Another…) for editing workflow.
- [ ] Implement lazy build for children on expand in Workspace View for performance.
- [ ] Implement performance virtualization for long sibling lists (>500) in Workspace View.
- [ ] Add tests for Workspace View filter to ensure it narrows & highlights results correctly.
- [ ] Add regression test for Workspace View to ensure only one list is rendered.
- [ ] Persist XSD catalog in app state and refresh on directory changes.
- [ ] Document the XSD auto-detection fallback ordering in code comments and link to PRD.
- [ ] Debounce schema detection while typing when live validation is on.
- [ ] Ensure parser and indexes are built before running validation after detection changes.
- [ ] Gate live validation on detection readiness to avoid running with a stale parser.

## Test Failures Triage (Latest run)
- [x] Re-ran full test suite; ProviderScope/missing placeholder issues resolved
- [x] EditorView rendered only root nodes — fixed to use visibleNodes for list rendering (UI now shows full tree)
- [ ] autosar_xsd_children_test: AR-PACKAGE/ELEMENTS should include APPLICATION-INTERFACE (fix XSD children resolution)
- [x] validation_report_test: invalid child under parent should be detected (align validator with XSD children map) — fixed by skipping value nodes and contextual lookup in validator
- [x] search_and_scroll_test: pumpAndSettle timeout (stabilize search delegate + scroll animations; add test-mode fast animations) — mitigated by bounded pumps and search delegate stability
- [x] integration/file_loading_integration_test: "File loading simulation works end-to-end" timeout — fixed by removing artificial delays and using bounded pumps
- [x] integration/file_loading_integration_test: "TabController state management works correctly" timeout — fixed by removing duplicate TabBar and bounded pumps
- [x] ui_ux_features_test: Collapse/Expand All buttons timeout — addressed by reintroducing Collapse/Expand All actions and updating test to drive provider deterministically. Note: one timeout still observed intermittently; further instrumentation pending.
- [x] Debug TabController test sees two TabBar widgets — resolved by removing duplicate TabBar in EditorView

### Additional failing tests after latest run
- [x] editing_schema_test.dart: updated to use `XmlExplorerApp` and current imports
- [x] file_handling_test.dart: updated to use `XmlExplorerApp`
- [x] performance_test.dart: updated to use `XmlExplorerApp`
- [x] search_test.dart: updated imports/usages (now passing)
- [ ] search_and_scroll_test.dart: reduced flakiness with bounded pumps; still failing intermittently on CI; add more deterministic search opening and/or provider-driven path

### Next steps (tests)
- Add Collapse/Expand All UI actions or refactor test to use provider API
- Update legacy test scaffolds to new AppRoot/HomeShell and editor provider APIs
- Tame pumpAndSettle in search_and_scroll_test with bounded pumps and fast animations

- [x] Create core/models/ (move ElementNode + related value objects) ✅
- [x] Create core/validation/ (split arxml_validator.dart into services + issue models) ✅
- [x] Convert root xsd_parser.dart into barrel exporting core/xsd/xsd_parser/* (eliminate duplication) ✅ (already barrel)
- [x] Move remaining element node UI helpers fully under features/editor/view/widgets (remove old top-level counterparts) ✅

- [x] Add barrel files (editor.dart, workspace.dart, validation.dart already partly there; ensure consistent exports) ✅
- [x] Evaluate splitting core into separate Dart package (mono-repo path) ✅ (packages/arxml_core scaffolded; mirrors models/xml/xsd/validation/refs; publish_to: none)
- [x] Update tests folder structure to mirror new package paths (e.g., test/core/..., test/features/editor/...) ✅ (directories created; migration of files will be incremental in follow-up PR)
- [x] Add architecture diagram (docs/architecture.md) referencing PRD & RULES ✅
- [x] Remove obsolete high-contrast related code fragments (confirm none left) ✅

- [ ] Focus outline & keyboard navigation order for rail & overflow menu
- [ ] Color contrast audit for new square indicator (WCAG AA)
- [ ] Tooltip text audit (clear, consistent verbs)

## Editing Workflow Fixes (New)
- [x] Successive Add Child improvements: expand parent if collapsed when adding ✅
- [x] Auto-select newly added child node after add ✅
- [x] Center newly added child (added ensureNodeCentered + pendingCenter consumption in EditorView)
- [ ] Optional loop add UX (Add Another…) (defer decision)
- [x] Test: addChild selects new node & parent expanded ✅

## Testing & Validation (post-implementation)
- [ ] Golden test for updated NavigationRail (light/dark)
- [x] Widget test: selecting each destination updates active view
- [ ] Widget test: overflow menu opens & triggers actions (e.g., toggle diagnostics)
- [ ] Accessibility test: focus traversal sequence includes rail then toolbar then editor
- [ ] Regression test: stray "ARXML" element no longer present
- [x] Update tests to import `XmlExplorerApp` and new providers (search_test, editing_schema_test, file_handling_test, performance_test)
- [x] Make file-open deterministic in tests by preferring `test/res/generic_ecu.arxml`

## Workspace View Refactor (Hierarchical + Status)
- [x] Remove duplicate lists (single hierarchical data model in state)
- [x] Represent workspace as directory tree (folders first, then files)
- [x] Collapsible directories with expand/collapse state persistence per session
- [x] Index status indicators per file (icons reflect status)
- [x] Directory aggregate status (based on children)
- [x] Show file count per directory (badge) & processed/total fraction in tooltip
- [ ] Lazy build children on expand for performance (avoid building entire large tree up front)
- [x] Sorting: directories alphabetically, files alphabetically (case-insensitive)
- [x] Filter box (scopes to names; simple match; branches included)
- [x] Selection/double‑click opens file and switches to Editor view
- [x] Double-click switches to Editor view automatically after opening
- [x] Context menu: Refresh Directory, Reveal in OS, Remove From Index (if implemented)
- [x] Error state styling (red icon + message tooltip) for parse/index failures
- [ ] Performance: virtualization / limited render for long sibling lists (>500) with chunked loading
- [x] Provider/state redesign: WorkspaceTreeNode with status & children
- [x] Migrate existing index results into hierarchical structure builder
- [x] Tests: tree build from sample nested structure
- [x] Tests: status indicator transitions (queued -> processing -> processed)
- [ ] Tests: filter narrows & highlights results, expands correct ancestors
- [ ] Regression test: only one list rendered (assert single Scrollable)
- [x] Lazy build children on expand for performance
  - UI-level: tree builder skips building child widgets for collapsed folders unless filtering
  - State-level: hydrate folder children on demand when expanding (no full tree prebuild)
  - Counts: computed from fileStatus by path prefix so badges work without hydrated children

## Editor Navigation & Selection Fixes
- [x] Center active element on keyboard navigation (alignment 0.5)
- [x] Remove dual highlighting (clear hover on key press via keyboardNavTick)
- [x] Single authoritative selection style (selectedNodeId-driven)
- [x] Smooth scroll animation (configurable via smoothScrollingProvider)
- [x] Provide API: ensureNodeCentered(nodeId)
- [ ] Test: keyboard ArrowDown keeps node centered after initial centering window (basic smoke added; expand later)
- [ ] Test: switching from mouse-click highlight to keyboard removes prior hover/active style (pending targeted test)

## NavigationRail Alignment & Visual Corrections
- [ ] Fix square (future) / current indicator alignment to exactly overlay icon bounds
- [ ] Adjust padding so indicator encloses icon+label without vertical drift
- [ ] Test: golden diff for indicator alignment (selected vs unselected)

### Bug fixes
- [x] NavigationRail taps not working due to inner GestureDetector in custom tile intercepting taps — removed to let NavigationRail handle selection

## XSD Schema Picker & Styling
 - [ ] Fix XSD selector visibility (white-on-white) by applying contrasting background or text color
 - [x] Add explicit schema badge (version + file basename) in AppBar
 - [x] Hover tooltip: full schema path
- [ ] Test: schema badge visible in light & dark themes (contrast >= 4.5)

## XSD Discovery & Catalog (New)
- [x] Discover XSDs at startup from bundled `res/` (recursive scan)
- [x] Allow user to add additional XSD directories
  - [x] Persist sources list across restarts (settings storage)
- [x] Manual "Rescan XSDs" action (Settings and/or XSD view)
- [x] Build versioned XSD catalog (map versions/aliases -> file paths)
- [x] Merge duplicates/variants (normalize `4-3-0` vs `4.3.0`, prefer newest)
- [ ] UI to manage sources & catalog
  - [x] Settings section controls (list, add/remove dirs, rescan)
  - [x] Optional dedicated XSD view in NavigationRail (catalog list, apply to active tab)
- [x] Integration: auto-detect uses catalog as primary lookup source
- [x] Integration: XSD picker dialog sources options from catalog (fallback to manual picker)
- [ ] Persist catalog in app state; refresh on directory changes
- [x] Tests: discovery from res, user dir add/remove, rescan updates catalog
  - Added: xsd_catalog_test.dart validates addSource + lookups by version/basename
  - Added: xsd_catalog_additional_test.dart covers bundled discovery, add/remove + rescan, and fallback chain
- [x] Tests: auto-detect resolves via catalog fallback chain

## XSD Auto-Detection & Validation Reliability
Goal: Make schema auto-detection deterministic, resilient to header variations, and observable. Validation must never run against the wrong schema; when no schema is detected, surface a clear, actionable warning.

### Detection robustness
- [x] Extract header parsing into a dedicated helper: parseSchemaHeader(xml) -> { schemaLocationPairs: List<(ns, href)>, noNsHref, versionHint }
- [x] Harden parsing of xsi:schemaLocation and noNamespaceSchemaLocation
  - [x] Handle newlines, tabs, multiple spaces between tokens
  - [x] Support odd/mismatched token counts (drop last dangling token gracefully)
  - [x] Accept both single URL (noNamespace) and pair list (namespaced)
- [x] Normalize version variants prior to lookup (e.g., 4-3-0 ⇄ 4.3.0; case-insensitive basename)
- [x] Prefer namespaced AUTOSAR URLs when present; otherwise fall back to basename/version heuristics

### Fallback and selection order
- [x] Implement strict ordering with acceptance criteria
  1) Catalog exact basename+version
  2) Catalog nearest version (same major/minor; prefer newest patch)
  3) Bundled res/ exact basename or nearest version
  4) Workspace search by basename
  5) Hard fallback: AUTOSAR_00050.xsd
- [ ] Document the ordering in code comments and PRD links (partial: noted in PLAN, add inline docstrings)

### Caching and invalidation
- [x] Cache detected schema per open file/tab (content hash based)
- [x] Invalidate cache on save, content change, or catalog rescan
- [ ] Debounce detection while typing (live validation on) to avoid thrash

### Observability & diagnostics
- [x] Add verbose detection logging (guarded by diagnostics toggle)
  - [x] Log header tokens, normalization decisions, and chosen source (catalog/bundled/workspace/fallback)
- [x] Surface detection source in AppBar schema badge tooltip (e.g., “Catalog: ...”, “Bundled: ...”)

### UX: missing/uncertain schema
- [x] Show a non-blocking warning when validation runs without a detected schema
  - [x] Badge state: warning color with tooltip and quick action “Pick schema…”
  - [x] Optional one-shot snackbar after open

### Validation sequencing
- [ ] Ensure parser + indexes are built before running validation after detection changes
- [ ] Gate live validation on detection readiness (avoid running with stale parser)

### Tests (add)
- Header parsing
  - [x] schemaLocation with newlines/tabs/multi-space resolves
  - [x] Odd token list handled gracefully
  - [x] noNamespaceSchemaLocation resolves basename
- Selection order
  - [x] Prefer catalog exact > nearest > bundled > workspace > default
  - [x] Version-only header resolves variant file name
- Validation
  - [ ] Known invalid child is still reported after detection rewrite
  - [ ] Warning appears when no schema available; clears after picking one

### Prereqs already implemented (for context)
- [x] Catalog-first detection integrated (basename/version lookup) — see “XSD Discovery & Catalog”
- [x] AppBar schema badge present with tooltip path
- [x] Tests exist for catalog discovery and detection fallback chain

# ITERATION 0 - Consolidated History (Pre-reset Accomplishments)

## Architecture, Parsing & Schema
- XSD parser relocation to core/xsd/xsd_parser (parser/index/resolver/tracing)
- ARXML loader split into core/xml/arxml_loader/{parser.dart, serializer.dart}
- Namespace‑agnostic XSD indexes, complexContent + restriction/extension handling
- Deeper traversal defaults (particleDepthLimit=4, groupDepthLimit=3), groupDepthLimit logic
- Substitution group resolution & child element caching
- Attribute discovery improvements
- Schema element definition map (buildElementIndex) for future versioned caching
- Auto‑detect XSD from ARXML header/version (schemaLocation + version variants)
- Per‑tab schema selection + detection override UI
- Fallback & workspace search for referenced XSDs

## Editing & Refactoring Features
- Convert element type (schema‑driven with child migration & pruning)
- Safe SHORT-NAME rename with sibling conflict detection
- Undo/Redo command stack (dirty flag recalculation)
- Add Child UX improvements (remember last choice, validation hint)
